                        <p1 className="Default-paragraph">
                            During my junior year of high school I took a java programming class and that was my first experience with computer programming. That was
                            the class that got me on the path to become a computer scientist. Although my journey was not smooth, there were even times where I felt I was not going to be
                            able to finish my program, I persevered through it all and finally reached the end and got my degree.

                            During my time at De Anza community college I worked at Central Computers in Sunnyvale, CA. There, I was able to put my interest in computers to work by building
                            workstations, gaming computers, and servers. While working there I was able to build my interpersonal skills by interacting with customers and co-workers to help
                            solve technical problems. I started out as a sales associate helping customers choose products for their needs and picking components for their custom built computers.
                            Later on I became a computer technician helping with building computers and servers as well as troubleshooting software issues for customers.
